# Colourspace
### Colours have never been so exciting!

Colourspace is a unique music sharing website with a non-ordinary concept. Instead of conventional
sites like Soundcloud, Bandcamp and others alike. A lot of the aspects of Colourspace are randomly
generated. The only thing which isn't randomly generated is the content shared on the platform. Users are
given randomly generated usernames along with a hexadecimal colour. You cannot change your
username once it is set, and your colour defines your presence on the platform. 

You are completely disconnected. Anoynmous. All of this combined with the features of a modern
music sharing platform. 

### Open Source

Colourspace is different in the sense that its completely open source. We are very open to
push requests and will greenlight any additions which we feel will add or improve the Colourspace
experience. If you want to get started with contributing. [Check out our wiki!](/wiki/)
